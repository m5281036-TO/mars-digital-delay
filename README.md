# Digital-Delay-Audio Effects Inspired by Mars Acoustic Environment

## abstract
This project presents new Digital Audio Effects (DAFX) which provide users with an interactive sound experience. 
This project is inspired by the recent discovery of the speed of sound in the acoustic environment onMars.
The program is finally deployed as a Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plugin to enable a user to control/modify the sound experience in real time.
